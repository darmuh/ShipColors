# ShipColors by darmuh
***
### Style your ship with your own personal colors!

- Mode "Generate Config" dynamically generates config items for materials throughout the ship for further customization.
	- Due to the dynamic nature of this mode, you may need to load the lobby multiple times to get some config items to show.
	- Also, working from an existing save file may detect scrap and other items within the ship. These can be filtered out in the setup config.
- Generate a Webpage to easily modify your config and update your settings.
	- See [here for example](https://darmuh.github.io/OpenLib/OpenLib/Website/Examples/ShipColors_Generated.cfg_generator.htm)
- Buttons added via LethalConfig!
	- Regenerate your config at any time
	- Generate a web page from your config at any time
	- Generated config items are added to the LethalConfig menu immediately
- Compatibility with darmuhsTerminalStuff will not generate Terminal customization config items when TerminalStuff customization is active.
- Any time you change a setting the customizations will **instantly** reload. 

**WARNING:** With the "Use Shared Textures" mode, this mod can change colors of materials not just on the ship. 
 - If you see odd colors on scrap or in the facility it's likely using the same shared texture.
