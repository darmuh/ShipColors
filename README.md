# ShipColors by darmuh
***
### Style your ship with your own personal colors!

- Currently supports changing a limited number of items around the ship using sharedMaterials.
	- May at some point get expanded with even MORE customization.
- Any time you change a setting the customizations will **instantly** reload. 

**WARNING:** In it's current state, this mod can change colors of materials not just on the ship. 
 - If you see odd colors on scrap or in the facility it's likely using the same shared texture.

See below some examples:
